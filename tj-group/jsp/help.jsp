<p>This search interface now searches the full text of documents in
the arXiv collection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you would like to restrict your search to a particular section
of the archive, please select the appropriate section heading in the
drop box above.</p>

<p>If you would like to search only specific fields, such as the title
or authors, you may also select them in the drop down box above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Results must contain ALL the search terms in the query. You may use
"OR" between your search terms to indicate that all words are not
required, for example "jack OR jill". Note, this is case
sensitive. You may also use quotes around queries to require all words
to appear in order.</p>

<p>Search results will be sorted by the match between the document and
the query. However, you can click "reorder by date" at the top of the
search results to order results in reverse chronological order. Please
note that sorting in this way may result in slower searching.</p>

<p>Please note that some documents in the index may have been poorly
converted to text when indexed, and so may not be returned as
expected.</p>

Working with the coaccess data produced by the Python scripts

<p>This package works with the multi-year historical coaccess data that have been assembled by the Python scripts (found in tj-group/server) from ArXiv.org's nightly logs. The main class, CoaccessServlet, is set up to serve these data over HTTP, to other applications (such as the SB recommender inside the My.ArXiv.server), or just to curious researchers. There is also another class here, CoaccessStats, which is used to compute various statistics on those data for research purposes.
